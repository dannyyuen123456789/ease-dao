# `1. Project Structure Practices`

## ![‚úî] 1.1 Structure your solution by components

**TL;DR:** The worst large applications pitfall is maintaining a huge code base with hundreds of dependencies - such a monolith slows down developers as they try to incorporate new features. Instead, partition your code into components, each gets its own folder or a dedicated codebase, and ensure that each unit is kept small and simple. Visit 'Read More' below to see examples of correct project structure

**Otherwise:** When developers who code new features struggle to realize the impact of their change and fear to break other dependent components - deployments become slower and riskier. It's also considered harder to scale-out when all the business units are not separated

üîó [**Read More: structure by components**](/sections/projectstructre/breakintcomponents.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 1.2 Layer your components, keep Express within its boundaries

**TL;DR:** Each component should contain 'layers' - a dedicated object for the web, logic, and data access code. This not only draws a clean separation of concerns but also significantly eases mocking and testing the system. Though this is a very common pattern, API developers tend to mix layers by passing the web layer objects (Express req, res) to business logic and data layers - this makes your application dependent on and accessible by Express only

**Otherwise:** App that mixes web objects with other layers cannot be accessed by testing code, CRON jobs, and other non-Express callers

üîó [**Read More: layer your app**](/sections/projectstructre/createlayers.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 1.3 Wrap common utilities as npm packages

**TL;DR:** In a large app that constitutes a large code base, cross-cutting-concern utilities like logger, encryption and alike, should be wrapped by your own code and exposed as private npm packages. This allows sharing them among multiple code bases and projects

**Otherwise:** You'll have to invent your own deployment and dependency wheel

üîó [**Read More: Structure by feature**](/sections/projectstructre/wraputilities.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 1.4 Separate Express 'app' and 'server'

**TL;DR:** Avoid the nasty habit of defining the entire [Express](https://expressjs.com/) app in a single huge file - separate your 'Express' definition to at least two files: the API declaration (app.js) and the networking concerns (WWW). For even better structure, locate your API declaration within components

**Otherwise:** Your API will be accessible for testing via HTTP calls only (slower and much harder to generate coverage reports). It probably won't be a big pleasure to maintain hundreds of lines of code in a single file

üîó [**Read More: separate Express 'app' and 'server'**](/sections/projectstructre/separateexpress.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 1.5 Use environment aware, secure and hierarchical config

**TL;DR:** A perfect and flawless configuration setup should ensure (a) keys can be read from file AND from environment variable (b) secrets are kept outside committed code (c) config is hierarchical for easier findability. There are a few packages that can help tick most of those boxes like [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc), [nconf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nconf) and [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config)

**Otherwise:** Failing to satisfy any of the config requirements will simply bog down the development or devops team. Probably both

üîó [**Read More: configuration best practices**](/sections/projectstructre/configguide.md)

<br/><br/><br/>

<p align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">‚¨Ü Return to top</a></p>

# `2. Error Handling Practices`

## ![‚úî] 2.1 Use Async-Await or promises for async error handling

**TL;DR:** Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell (a.k.a the pyramid of doom). The best gift you can give to your code is using a reputable promise library or async-await instead which enables a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch

**Otherwise:** Node.js callback style, function(err, response), is a promising way to un-maintainable code due to the mix of error handling with casual code, excessive nesting, and awkward coding patterns

üîó [**Read More: avoiding callbacks**](/sections/errorhandling/asyncerrorhandling.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.2 Use only the built-in Error object

**TL;DR:** Many throw errors as a string or as some custom type ‚Äì this complicates the error handling logic and the interoperability between modules. Whether you reject a promise, throw an exception or emit an error ‚Äì using only the built-in Error object (or an object that extends the built-in Error object) will increase uniformity and prevent loss of information

**Otherwise:** When invoking some component, being uncertain which type of errors come in return ‚Äì it makes proper error handling much harder. Even worse, using custom types to describe errors might lead to loss of critical error information like the stack trace!

üîó [**Read More: using the built-in error object**](/sections/errorhandling/useonlythebuiltinerror.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.3 Distinguish operational vs programmer errors

**TL;DR:** Operational errors (e.g. API received an invalid input) refer to known cases where the error impact is fully understood and can be handled thoughtfully. On the other hand, programmer error (e.g. trying to read undefined variable) refers to unknown code failures that dictate to gracefully restart the application

**Otherwise:** You may always restart the application when an error appears, but why let ~5000 online users down because of a minor, predicted, operational error? the opposite is also not ideal ‚Äì keeping the application up when an unknown issue (programmer error) occurred might lead to an unpredicted behavior. Differentiating the two allows acting tactfully and applying a balanced approach based on the given context

üîó [**Read More: operational vs programmer error**](/sections/errorhandling/operationalvsprogrammererror.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.4 Handle errors centrally, not within an Express middleware

**TL;DR:** Error handling logic such as mail to admin and logging should be encapsulated in a dedicated and centralized object that all endpoints (e.g. Express middleware, cron jobs, unit-testing) call when an error comes in

**Otherwise:** Not handling errors within a single place will lead to code duplication and probably to improperly handled errors

üîó [**Read More: handling errors in a centralized place**](/sections/errorhandling/centralizedhandling.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.5 Document API errors using Swagger or GraphQL

**TL;DR:** Let your API callers know which errors might come in return so they can handle these thoughtfully without crashing. For RESTful APIs, this is usually done with documentation frameworks like Swagger. If you're using GraphQL, you can utilize your schema and comments as well.

**Otherwise:** An API client might decide to crash and restart only because it received back an error it couldn‚Äôt understand. Note: the caller of your API might be you (very typical in a microservice environment)

üîó [**Read More: documenting API errors in Swagger or GraphQL**](/sections/errorhandling/documentingusingswagger.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.6 Exit the process gracefully when a stranger comes to town

**TL;DR:** When an unknown error occurs (a developer error, see best practice 2.3) - there is uncertainty about the application healthiness. A common practice suggests restarting the process carefully using a process management tool like [Forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) or [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/)

**Otherwise:** When an unfamiliar exception occurs, some object might be in a faulty state (e.g. an event emitter which is used globally and not firing events anymore due to some internal failure) and all future requests might fail or behave crazily

üîó [**Read More: shutting the process**](/sections/errorhandling/shuttingtheprocess.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.7 Use a mature logger to increase error visibility

**TL;DR:** A set of mature logging tools like [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston), [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan), [Log4js](http://stritti.github.io/log4js/) or [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino), will speed-up error discovery and understanding. So forget about console.log

**Otherwise:** Skimming through console.logs or manually through messy text file without querying tools or a decent log viewer might keep you busy at work until late

üîó [**Read More: using a mature logger**](/sections/errorhandling/usematurelogger.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.8 Test error flows using your favorite test framework

**TL;DR:** Whether professional automated QA or plain manual developer testing ‚Äì Ensure that your code not only satisfies positive scenarios but also handles and returns the right errors. Testing frameworks like Mocha & Chai can handle this easily (see code examples within the "Gist popup")

**Otherwise:** Without testing, whether automatically or manually, you can‚Äôt rely on your code to return the right errors. Without meaningful errors ‚Äì there‚Äôs no error handling

üîó [**Read More: testing error flows**](/sections/errorhandling/testingerrorflows.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.9 Discover errors and downtime using APM products

**TL;DR:** Monitoring and performance products (a.k.a APM) proactively gauge your codebase or API so they can automagically highlight errors, crashes and slow parts that you were missing

**Otherwise:** You might spend great effort on measuring API performance and downtimes, probably you‚Äôll never be aware which are your slowest code parts under real-world scenario and how these affect the UX

üîó [**Read More: using APM products**](/sections/errorhandling/apmproducts.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.10 Catch unhandled promise rejections

**TL;DR:** Any exception thrown within a promise will get swallowed and discarded unless a developer didn‚Äôt forget to explicitly handle. Even if your code is subscribed to `process.uncaughtException`! Overcome this by registering to the event `process.unhandledRejection`

**Otherwise:** Your errors will get swallowed and leave no trace. Nothing to worry about

üîó [**Read More: catching unhandled promise rejection**](/sections/errorhandling/catchunhandledpromiserejection.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 2.11 Fail fast, validate arguments using a dedicated library

**TL;DR:** This should be part of your Express best practices ‚Äì Assert API input to avoid nasty bugs that are much harder to track later. The validation code is usually tedious unless you are using a very cool helper library like Joi

**Otherwise:** Consider this ‚Äì your function expects a numeric argument ‚ÄúDiscount‚Äù which the caller forgets to pass, later on, your code checks if Discount!=0 (amount of allowed discount is greater than zero), then it will allow the user to enjoy a discount. OMG, what a nasty bug. Can you see it?

üîó [**Read More: failing fast**](/sections/errorhandling/failfast.md)

<br/><br/><br/>

<p align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">‚¨Ü Return to top</a></p>

# `3. Code Style Practices`

## ![‚úî] 3.1 Use ESLint

**TL;DR:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org) is the de-facto standard for checking possible code errors and fixing code style, not only to identify nitty-gritty spacing issues but also to detect serious code anti-patterns like developers throwing errors without classification. Though ESLint can automatically fix code styles, other tools like [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) and [beautify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify) are more powerful in formatting the fix and work in conjunction with ESLint

**Otherwise:** Developers will focus on tedious spacing and line-width concerns and time might be wasted overthinking the project's code style

üîó [**Read More: Using ESLint and Prettier**](/sections/codestylepractices/eslint_prettier.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.2 Node.js specific plugins

**TL;DR:** On top of ESLint standard rules that cover vanilla JavaScript, add Node.js specific plugins like [eslint-plugin-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-node), [eslint-plugin-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-mocha) and [eslint-plugin-node-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security)

**Otherwise:** Many faulty Node.js code patterns might escape under the radar. For example, developers might require(variableAsPath) files with a variable given as path which allows attackers to execute any JS script. Node.js linters can detect such patterns and complain early

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.3 Start a Codeblock's Curly Braces on the Same Line

**TL;DR:** The opening curly braces of a code block should be on the same line as the opening statement

### Code Example

```javascript
// Do
function someFunction() {
  // code block
}

// Avoid
function someFunction() 
{
  // code block
}
```

**Otherwise:** Deferring from this best practice might lead to unexpected results, as seen in the StackOverflow thread below:

üîó [**Read more:** "Why do results vary based on curly brace placement?" (StackOverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3641519/why-does-a-results-vary-based-on-curly-brace-placement)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.4 Separate your statements properly

No matter if you use semicolons or not to separate your statements, knowing the common pitfalls of improper linebreaks or automatic semicolon insertion, will help you to eliminate regular syntax errors.

**TL;DR:** Use ESLint to gain awareness about separation concerns. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or [Standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) can automatically resolve these issues.

**Otherwise:** As seen in the previous section, JavaScript's interpreter automatically adds a semicolon at the end of a statement if there isn't one, or considers a statement as not ended where it should, which might lead to some undesired results. You can use assignments and avoid using immediate invoked function expressions to prevent most of unexpected errors.

### Code example

```javascript
// Do
function doThing() {
    // ...
}

doThing()

// Do

const items = [1, 2, 3]
items.forEach(console.log)

// Avoid ‚Äî throws exception
const m = new Map()
const a = [1,2,3]
[...m.values()].forEach(console.log)
> [...m.values()].forEach(console.log)
>  ^^^
> SyntaxError: Unexpected token ...

// Avoid ‚Äî throws exception
const count = 2 // it tries to run 2(), but 2 is not a function
(function doSomething() {
  // do something amazing
}())
// put a semicolon before the immediate invoked function, after the const definition, save the return value of the anonymous function to a variable or avoid IIFEs alltogether
```

üîó [**Read more:** "Semi ESLint rule"](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi)
üîó [**Read more:** "No unexpected multiline ESLint rule"](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unexpected-multiline)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.5 Name your functions

**TL;DR:** Name all functions, including closures and callbacks. Avoid anonymous functions. This is especially useful when profiling a node app. Naming all functions will allow you to easily understand what you're looking at when checking a memory snapshot

**Otherwise:** Debugging production issues using a core dump (memory snapshot) might become challenging as you notice significant memory consumption from anonymous functions

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.6 Use naming conventions for variables, constants, functions and classes

**TL;DR:** Use **_lowerCamelCase_** when naming constants, variables and functions and **_UpperCamelCase_** (capital first letter as well) when naming classes. This will help you to easily distinguish between plain variables/functions, and classes that require instantiation. Use descriptive names, but try to keep them short

**Otherwise:** Javascript is the only language in the world which allows invoking a constructor ("Class") directly without instantiating it first. Consequently, Classes and function-constructors are differentiated by starting with UpperCamelCase

### 3.6 Code Example

```javascript
// for class name we use UpperCamelCase
class SomeClassExample {}

// for const names we use the const keyword and lowerCamelCase
const config = {
  key: "value"
};

// for variables and functions names we use lowerCamelCase
let someVariableExample = "value";
function doSomething() {}
```

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.7 Prefer const over let. Ditch the var

**TL;DR:** Using `const` means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. Preferring `const` will help you to not be tempted to use the same variable for different uses, and make your code clearer. If a variable needs to be reassigned, in a for loop, for example, use `let` to declare it. Another important aspect of `let` is that a variable declared using it is only available in the block scope in which it was defined. `var` is function scoped, not block scoped, and [shouldn't be used in ES6](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-var-anymore-f109a58b9b70) now that you have `const` and `let` at your disposal

**Otherwise:** Debugging becomes way more cumbersome when following a variable that frequently changes

üîó [**Read more: JavaScript ES6+: var, let, or const?** ](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-es6-var-let-or-const-ba58b8dcde75)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.8 Require modules first, not inside functions

**TL;DR:** Require modules at the beginning of each file, before and outside of any functions. This simple best practice will not only help you easily and quickly tell the dependencies of a file right at the top but also avoids a couple of potential problems

**Otherwise:** Requires are run synchronously by Node.js. If they are called from within a function, it may block other requests from being handled at a more critical time. Also, if a required module or any of its own dependencies throw an error and crash the server, it is best to find out about it as soon as possible, which might not be the case if that module is required from within a function

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.9 Require modules by folders, opposed to the files directly

**TL;DR:** When developing a module/library in a folder, place an index.js file that exposes the module's internals so every consumer will pass through it. This serves as an 'interface' to your module and eases future changes without breaking the contract

**Otherwise:** Changing the internal structure of files or the signature may break the interface with clients

### 3.9 Code example

```javascript
// Do
module.exports.SMSProvider = require("./SMSProvider");
module.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require("./SMSNumberResolver");

// Avoid
module.exports.SMSProvider = require("./SMSProvider/SMSProvider.js");
module.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require("./SMSNumberResolver/SMSNumberResolver.js");
```

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.10 Use the `===` operator

**TL;DR:** Prefer the strict equality operator `===` over the weaker abstract equality operator `==`. `==` will compare two variables after converting them to a common type. There is no type conversion in `===`, and both variables must be of the same type to be equal

**Otherwise:** Unequal variables might return true when compared with the `==` operator

### 3.10 Code example

```javascript
"" == "0"; // false
0 == ""; // true
0 == "0"; // true

false == "false"; // false
false == "0"; // true

false == undefined; // false
false == null; // false
null == undefined; // true

" \t\r\n " == 0; // true
```

All statements above will return false if used with `===`

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.11 Use Async Await, avoid callbacks

**TL;DR:** Node 8 LTS now has full support for Async-await. This is a new way of dealing with asynchronous code which supersedes callbacks and promises. Async-await is non-blocking, and it makes asynchronous code look synchronous. The best gift you can give to your code is using async-await which provides a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch

**Otherwise:** Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell - this style forces to check errors all over, deal with awkward code nesting and makes it difficult to reason about the code flow

üîó[**Read more:** Guide to async await 1.0](https://github.com/yortus/asyncawait)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.12 Use arrow function expressions (=>)

**TL;DR:** Though it's recommended to use async-await and avoid function parameters when dealing with older APIs that accept promises or callbacks - arrow functions make the code structure more compact and keep the lexical context of the root function (i.e. `this`)

**Otherwise:** Longer code (in ES5 functions) is more prone to bugs and cumbersome to read

üîó [**Read more: It‚Äôs Time to Embrace Arrow Functions**](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/familiarity-bias-is-holding-you-back-its-time-to-embrace-arrow-functions-3d37e1a9bb75)

<br/><br/><br/>

<p align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">‚¨Ü Return to top</a></p>

# `4. Testing And Overall Quality Practices`

## ![‚úî] 4.1 At the very least, write API (component) testing

**TL;DR:** Most projects just don't have any automated testing due to short timetables or often the 'testing project' ran out of control and was abandoned. For that reason, prioritize and start with API testing which is the easiest way to write and provides more coverage than unit testing (you may even craft API tests without code using tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). Afterward, should you have more resources and time, continue with advanced test types like unit testing, DB testing, performance testing, etc

**Otherwise:** You may spend long days on writing unit tests to find out that you got only 20% system coverage

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.2 Include 3 parts in each test name

**TL;DR:** Make the test speak at the requirements level so it's self explanatory also to QA engineers and developers who are not familiar with the code internals. State in the test name what is being tested (unit under test), under what circumstances and what is the expected result

**Otherwise:** A deployment just failed, a test named ‚ÄúAdd product‚Äù failed. Does this tell you what exactly is malfunctioning?

üîó [**Read More: Include 3 parts in each test name**](/sections/testingandquality/3-parts-in-name.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.3 Structure tests by the AAA pattern

**TL;DR:** Structure your tests with 3 well-separated sections: Arrange, Act & Assert (AAA). The first part includes the test setup, then the execution of the unit under test and finally the assertion phase. Following this structure guarantees that the reader spends no brain CPU on understanding the test plan

**Otherwise:** Not only you spend long daily hours on understanding the main code, now also what should have been the simple part of the day (testing) stretches your brain

üîó [**Read More: Structure tests by the AAA pattern**](/sections/testingandquality/aaa.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.4 Detect code issues with a linter

**TL;DR:** Use a code linter to check basic quality and detect anti-patterns early. Run it before any test and add it as a pre-commit git-hook to minimize the time needed to review and correct any issue. Also check [Section 3](#3-code-style-practices) on Code Style Practices

**Otherwise:** You may let pass some anti-pattern and possible vulnerable code to your production environment.

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.5 Avoid global test fixtures and seeds, add data per-test

**TL;DR:** To prevent tests coupling and easily reason about the test flow, each test should add and act on its own set of DB rows. Whenever a test needs to pull or assume the existence of some DB data - it must explicitly add that data and avoid mutating any other records

**Otherwise:** Consider a scenario where deployment is aborted due to failing tests, team is now going to spend precious investigation time that ends in a sad conclusion: the system works well, the tests however interfere with each other and break the build

üîó [**Read More: Avoid global test fixtures**](/sections/testingandquality/avoid-global-test-fixture.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.6 Constantly inspect for vulnerable dependencies

**TL;DR:** Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities. This can get easily tamed using community and commercial tools such as üîó [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit) and üîó [snyk.io](https://snyk.io) that can be invoked from your CI on every build

**Otherwise:** Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.7 Tag your tests

**TL;DR:** Different tests must run on different scenarios: quick smoke, IO-less, tests should run when a developer saves or commits a file, full end-to-end tests usually run when a new pull request is submitted, etc. This can be achieved by tagging tests with keywords like #cold #api #sanity so you can grep with your testing harness and invoke the desired subset. For example, this is how you would invoke only the sanity test group with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): mocha --grep 'sanity'

**Otherwise:** Running all the tests, including tests that perform dozens of DB queries, any time a developer makes a small change can be extremely slow and keeps developers away from running tests

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.8 Check your test coverage, it helps to identify wrong test patterns

**TL;DR:** Code coverage tools like [Istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs)/[NYC](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) are great for 3 reasons: it comes for free (no effort is required to benefit this reports), it helps to identify a decrease in testing coverage, and last but not least it highlights testing mismatches: by looking at colored code coverage reports you may notice, for example, code areas that are never tested like catch clauses (meaning that tests only invoke the happy paths and not how the app behaves on errors). Set it t
